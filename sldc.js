    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "seek to understand the goals and parameters for what the project has in mind."
const design = "Set up a path for how you want to create your code."
const implementation = "Create the code you planned out in the design process"
const testingAndIntegration = "Check if the code you designed is working for your intended purpose"
const maintain = "Make sure your code is still working"
